    <p>You can't be certain of anything. This is due to the inherent nature of premises (axioms). Everything, at the end of the day, is just beliefs that we hold. This statement itself is a belief, highlighting the limitations of absolute certainty within a system based on beliefs. It can't hold meaning when subjected to itself, becoming self-defeating in the sense that it's just another belief. It's like going to infinity by counting – it never proves everything. By accepting this, we see it not as a constructive argument, but one that tries to exploit the game of logic..</p>
